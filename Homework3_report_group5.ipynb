        "This code sets up a 1D FDTD simulation to analyze electromagnetic wave propagation through a medium with two distinct permittivities separated by an interface. It begins by defining the spatial (*dx*) and temporal (*time_span*) resolutions and computes the number of grid points (Nx). The spatial grid (x) spans from -x_span/2 to x_span/2, where x_span represents the total spatial extent of the simulation domain. The relative permittivity (eps_rel) is initialized to unity (vacuum) but modified to reflect different permittivities (n1^2 and n2^2) on either side of a specified interface (x_interface). The code identifies the grid index closest to the source position and adjusts it accordingly. Finally, it calls the fdtd_1d function to perform the simulation, yielding the electric field (Ez), magnetic field (Hy), spatial coordinates (x), and time steps (t)."

        "The function fdtd_3d implements a 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation to model the time evolution of electromagnetic fields in a three-dimensional space. The function is designed to simulate how a pulsed, spatially extended current source interacts with a medium characterized by a given relative permittivity distribution. It returns slices of the electromagnetic field components at a specific z-coordinate, allowing for detailed analysis of field behavior over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fdtd_3d function begins by defining essential physical constants such as the speed of light (c), vacuum permeability (μ₀), and vacuum permittivity (ε₀). These constants are used to calculate the time step (dt), ensuring numerical stability by satisfying the Courant stability condition, which is critical for accurate simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation. The number of time steps (Nt) is derived from the total simulation duration (time_span), and a time array (t) is created for tracking the simulation progress. Zero-filled matrices for electric (ex, ey, ez) and magnetic (hx, hy, hz) fields are initialized to store the field values at each grid point in the computational domain. The function enforces perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions by setting the field components to zero at the edges of the computational domain, simulating reflective boundaries that prevent fields from escaping the simulation area.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main simulation loop iterates over each time step to update the electric and magnetic fields using Maxwell's equations. The electric fields are updated based on the curl of the magnetic fields and current source terms (jx, jy, jz), which are modulated by a Gaussian envelope and a sinusoidal function to represent the pulse. The magnetic fields are updated similarly using the curl of the electric fields, with spatial derivatives implemented through the np.roll function, which shifts field values along different axes. The function collects the specified field components (ex, ey, ez, hx, hy, hz) at a given z-plane index (z_ind) and stores them in arrays, allowing for examination of field evolution at a specific cross-section. Post-processing involves interpolating the fields to average values over adjacent grid points, smoothing the data to better represent continuous fields. The function returns the selected field slices (F1 and F2) and the corresponding time values (t), saving data at intervals specified by output_step to focus on key time points and manage data efficiently."
